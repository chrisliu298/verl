| **BrowserGym (ServiceNow)** ([GitHub][1])                                                          | **Yes (Playwright)** ([OpenReview][2])                                                                                                                                                                                                              | **DOM/HTML + AXTree + screenshot** (+ error/msg/history) ([arXiv][3])                                                                                                                                                                         | **Primarily sync Gym-style** (`reset/step`). Wrapping as async is doable (thread/process/RPC) but not “native asyncio” out of the box. ([OpenReview][2])              | Yes (instantiate many envs; common pattern is process-level parallelism). ([OpenReview][2])                 | **Yes**, but **depends on chosen action space** (supports multiple action spaces, including “python” and more structured variants). ([arXiv][3])                                                       | **Mostly yes**: Playwright can visit any URL; BrowserGym tasks/benchmarks may be site-specific, but nothing is inherently CDP-only or Selenium-bound. For **pywb**, it should work if you point start URLs at your pywb server. | **2026‑01‑20** ([GitHub][1])  | **Yes (ecosystem-level):** WARC-Bench explicitly includes RLVR infra built on BrowserGym; TRL added a BrowserGym example. ([GitHub][4])       |
| **AgentLab (ServiceNow)** (framework around BrowserGym) ([GitHub][5])                              | **Indirectly yes** (via BrowserGym/Playwright) ([OpenReview][2])                                                                                                                                                                                    | Inherits BrowserGym observation stack (DOM/AXTree/screenshot). ([OpenReview][2])                                                                                                                                                              | Not primarily an asyncio-first env API; more of an experimentation/evaluation harness. Async wrapping depends on how you run BrowserGym underneath. ([OpenReview][2]) | Yes (designed for scalable evaluation). ([OpenReview][2])                                                   | Inherits BrowserGym action spaces. ([OpenReview][2])                                                                                                                                                   | Same as BrowserGym: generally URL-agnostic at the browser layer; benchmarks are task-specific.                                                                                                                                  | **2026‑01‑20** ([GitHub][5])  | Primarily evaluation/benchmarking; not a drop-in RL trainer, but commonly used for trajectory collection around BrowserGym. ([OpenReview][2]) |
| **WebArena** ([GitHub][6])                                                                         | **Yes (Playwright)** (env code drives a real browser) ([GitHub][6])                                                                                                                                                                                 | **AXTree (“accessibility_tree”) + HTML + image** ([GitHub][6])                                                                                                                                                                                | **Sync Gym-like** (`reset/step`). Can be wrapped as async via thread/process RPC. ([GitHub][6])                                                                       | Yes (multiple env instances).                                                                               | **Partially**: actions are created through a structured DSL string (`create_id_based_action("click [id]")`). Not free-form NL, but **still string-parsed** unless you bypass that layer. ([GitHub][6]) | **Mostly benchmark-tied** (expects configured sites/URLs), but technically can navigate to arbitrary URLs if you change configs. pywb should work if your config points to the pywb-hosted URLs. ([GitHub][6])                  | **2025‑11‑26** ([GitHub][7])  | Used in RL-oriented repos; RLVR-World explicitly acknowledges building on **verl** + **webarena**.

| **WARC-Bench** (Orby) – web-archive replay benchmark built on BrowserGym ([GitHub][4])             | **Yes, via BrowserGym/Playwright** ([GitHub][4])                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Underlying BrowserGym supports DOM/AXTree/screenshot; WARC-Bench’s reference agent is “pure-vision,” but the infra is BrowserGym-compatible. ([GitHub][4])                                                                                    | Likely sync at the env layer (BrowserGym-style); designed for training pipelines (SFT + RLVR) rather than asyncio-native stepping. ([GitHub][4])                      | Yes (benchmark infra supports running many tasks).                                                          | Uses **BrowserGym actions** (click/type/scroll/hover/drag/key_press/wait/complete). ([GitHub][4])                                                                                                      | **Archive replay:** uses a bundled WARC-serving stack (“webreplay-standalone”), not pywb; but if your agent/env can browse arbitrary URLs, you can typically swap the base URLs to pywb-hosted replays. ([GitHub][4])           | **2025‑12‑16** ([GitHub][11]) | **Explicit RLVR support included** (verifiable rewards + RLVR over SFT). ([GitHub][4])                                                        |
| **browser-use** (Python package) ([GitHub][12])                                                    | Historically **yes (Playwright)**; verify current backend because the project is evolving quickly. (Your requirement excludes CDP-only wrappers; you should confirm it still uses Playwright for execution in the revision you pin.) ([GitHub][13]) | Typically provides **LLM-friendly page text representations** and action tools; exact supported formats (HTML vs markdown vs AXTree) vary by version/config—verify before committing.                                                         | Often **async-friendly** in practice (many Playwright-first agent libs are), but you must confirm the specific API surface (async methods vs sync wrappers).          | Yes (library should allow multiple independent browser contexts/sessions).                                  | Generally **yes** (tool-like API: click/type/scroll/goto, etc.).                                                                                                                                       | **Yes** (arbitrary URLs). pywb replay should work if it’s just another URL.                                                                                                                                                     | **2026‑02‑10** ([GitHub][12]) | Not commonly shipped as an RL “env with rewards”; typically a tool layer you’d wrap with your own task+reward harness.                        |
| **Microsoft Playwright MCP server** (Node; tool server) ([GitHub][14])                             | **Yes (Playwright)**, but **Node/MCP**, not Python-native. ([GitHub][14])                                                                                                                                                                           | **Accessibility snapshot** (structured; can be saved to **markdown**) + optional screenshot tool. ([GitHub][14])                                                                                                                              | Not a Python env; you’d integrate via MCP client (async I/O) or subprocess. Wrapping into an async “env-as-a-service” is straightforward.                             | Potentially yes; but session isolation is something you must design (often: one server per rollout worker). | **Yes** (strongly structured tool schema: `browser_snapshot`, `browser_type`, `browser_select_option`, `browser_wait_for`, etc.). ([GitHub][14])                                                       | **Yes** (arbitrary URLs), including pywb-hosted replay URLs.                                                                                                                                                                    | **2026‑02‑09** ([GitHub][15]) | No direct RL integration; best viewed as a **tool execution backend** to plug into an RL loop you already have.                               |
| **Magentic-UI** (Microsoft) – includes a Playwright-driven “WebSurfer” component ([Microsoft][16]) | **Yes (Playwright)** (WebSurfer executes browser actions) ([Microsoft][16])                                                                                                                                                                         | In Microsoft’s description, agents can emit standard Playwright mouse/keyboard actions; WebSurfer is associated with structured browsing actions and (in their ecosystem) often pairs with structured page representations.

## Recommendation for your exact requirements (verl-style async rollouts + structured tools + text obs + pywb)

### Closest “drop-in” starting point for RL training: **BrowserGym (core)**

BrowserGym is the only option in this list that is simultaneously:

* a **web browser environment** (not just a tool library),
* **Playwright-driven**, and
* already designed around **RL-style tasks, termination, and reward validation**, with **multiple text-based observation modalities** (DOM/HTML + AXTree) plus screenshots. ([OpenReview][2])

**Main mismatch with your constraints:** the stepping API is effectively **sync** (Gym-style), not a native `async def step()` that cleanly fits `asyncio.gather()`.

**Least-adaptation path that still scales to 32–128 rollouts:**

1. **Keep BrowserGym as-is**, but run each env instance behind an **env-as-a-service boundary**:

   * one OS **process** per env (or a small pool of envs per process),
   * async RPC from your rollout coroutine (e.g., asyncio + multiprocessing pipes, Ray actors, gRPC, or an HTTP microservice).
2. In each rollout coroutine, maintain sequential tool execution by design (await each RPC call in order).
3. Across rollouts, you get full concurrency via `asyncio.gather()` and process parallelism.

This matches how high-throughput web rollouts are typically engineered in practice, because Chromium/Playwright concurrency is usually bottlenecked by CPU/memory anyway.

**Why this is still the “least work”:**

* You get **AXTree + HTML** out of the box (your requirement #2). ([arXiv][3])
* You get a **benchmark/task ecosystem** + built-in validation hooks (setup/teardown/validate) instead of inventing reward plumbing. ([arXiv][3])
* It’s **actively maintained** (commit on 2026‑01‑20). ([GitHub][1])

**RL ecosystem signal:** BrowserGym is already appearing in RL-adjacent integrations (e.g., TRL example) and downstream RLVR benchmarks like WARC-Bench build on it. ([GitHub][31])

---

### Best fit for your observation requirements with a simpler env API (but more benchmark-tied): **WebArena**

If you can tolerate benchmark coupling (or you’re okay reconfiguring it), WebArena provides:

* **AXTree and HTML observation modes** ([GitHub][6])
* a simple **Gym-like** `reset/step` loop ([GitHub][6])
* active-enough maintenance (latest commit 2025‑11‑26) ([GitHub][7])

**Main mismatch:** actions are frequently routed via a **string DSL** (`create_id_based_action("click [id]")`) which is structured but still **string-parsed**. ([GitHub][6])
If your training stack requires strict JSON-schema tool calls, you’ll likely implement:

* a JSON schema → DSL adapter, or
* direct construction of action objects (if available internally), bypassing string parsing.

**verl integration:** there’s at least one RLVR-related repo acknowledging both `verl` and `webarena` as dependencies/inspirations, which is a positive signal for feasibility. ([GitHub][8])

---

### Best “tool-executor backend” if you decide to build your own env wrapper: **Playwright MCP server**

If you want:

* extremely clean **structured tool schemas** (click/type/select/wait/snapshot),
* **text-first observation** via accessibility snapshots rendered to **markdown**, and
* you’re okay running a **Node** service rather than Python,

then Playwright MCP is a strong execution backend. ([GitHub][14])

**What you’d still need to build:**

* a Gym-like wrapper (`reset/step`), including termination/reward hooks
* session management (one MCP server per rollout worker, or explicit session routing)
* optional HTML extraction if you require “HTML mode” in addition to markdown snapshot

This approach can fit verl’s async rollouts very naturally (async tool calls over IPC/stdio/HTTP), but it is more “build the env yourself” than BrowserGym/WebArena.

---

### For **web-archive replay** (pywb-like): use **BrowserGym** + “swap the base URL”

No project here is “pywb-native” as a first-class feature. The best practical route is:

* use a Playwright-driven env (BrowserGym or WebArena),
* point start URLs at your **pywb replay host** (e.g., `http://localhost:<pywb_port>/...`),
* keep everything else the same.

If you want an existence proof for offline replay + verifiable rewards, **WARC-Bench** is the closest reference implementation (it serves WARC replays via its own server and explicitly includes RLVR infra). ([GitHub][4])

---

## Concrete “least adaptation” choice for your stack (verl + asyncio.gather + 32–128 sessions)

**Pick BrowserGym as the environment substrate**, and implement a thin **AsyncEnvAdapter** that:

* runs each BrowserGym instance in its own **process** (recommended) or a dedicated thread,
* exposes `async reset()` and `async step(tool_call)` to your rollout coroutine,
* enforces **per-env sequential execution** simply by awaiting each step call (optionally add an `asyncio.Lock` per env instance).

If you later need a stricter tool-call contract:

* restrict BrowserGym to its more structured action spaces (avoid “python” action space for RL training stability/safety), per the action-space discussion in the WorkArena/BrowserGym papers. ([arXiv][3])

**If you instead want a tool-first executor and plan to write your own rewards/tasks**, use:

* **Playwright MCP** as the executor (best structured tools + markdown snapshot) ([GitHub][14])
  or
* **browser-use** if (and only if) you confirm it still executes actions through Playwright and provides the two text observation formats you require in the version you pin. ([GitHub][12])
